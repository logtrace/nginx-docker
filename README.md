# NGINX docker
This repository contains a Dockerfile extended from the original docker image to setup the nginx for a ghost optimization script. The idea is to make it easier and quick to setup ghost blog with nginx for personal bloggers.

The original optimization script is taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/vvo/7414035#file-ghost-performance-nginx-config-conf)
